Harvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt said, &quot;People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!&quot; Clayton Christensen said, “People buy products and services to get a job done.” In his most recent book he says, “Customers don’t buy products; they pull them into their life to make progress.”
&quot;</p> <p>&quot;innovation more of an art than a science.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;
While nearly every manager agrees that the goal of innovation is to devise solutions that address unmet customer needs, a common language for communicating a need does not exist.&quot; (p.41)</p> <p>&quot;Despite the available needs-gathering methods, companies nearly always fail to uncover all or even most of the customer’s needs.&quot;
(p.41)</p> <p>&quot;In the September, 2016 Harvard Business Review article, “Know Your Customers’ Jobs to be Done,” Clayton Christensen states, “Innovation can be far more predictable—and far more profitable—if you start by identifying the jobs that customers are struggling to get done.” (p.20)</p> <p>&quot;The goal of innovation is straightforward: to come up with solutions that address unmet customer needs. &quot; (p30)
&quot;As I will explain, the “ideas-first” approach is inherently flawed&quot;
Ideas first vs needs first</p> <p>Chapter 2 introduces the solution: the Jobs-to-be-Done Needs Framework.</p> <p>This structural flaw in the needs- first approach is corrected in the Outcome-Driven Innovation process.</p> <p>&quot;
In what I call the “ideas-first” approach, companies brainstorm or otherwise come up with product or service ideas and then test them with customers to see how well the ideas address the customer’s needs. In the “needs-first” approach, companies first learn what the customer’s needs are, then discover which needs are unmet, and then devise a solution that addresses those unmet needs.&quot;  (p30)</p> <ul><li>Robert Cooper, “Winning at New Products: Accelerating the Process from Idea to Launch,” 3rd ed. (Da Capo Press, 2001), 311.</li></ul> <p>people “hire” products to get a “job” done (p18)</p> <p>&quot;Clay was quick to key in on the fact that the focus of our approach was not on the customer or the product, but rather on the underlying process the customer was trying to execute, or, as he eventually came to call it, the “job” the customer was trying to get done.&quot; (p18)</p> <p>&quot;Tying customer-defined metrics to the underlying process the customer was trying to execute was the key to success.&quot;</p> <p>The purpose of this first assessment is to prototype and document your proposed solution for your student experience web application. You are required to get to the very essence of</p> <ul><li><p>identify the metrics that customers use to judge the value  -   (Outcome-Driven Innovation</p></li> <li><p>students already have a stytem</p></li> <li><p>validate an application</p></li> <li><p>methodology</p></li> <li><p>metrics</p></li> <li><p>interviews with students</p></li> <li><p>get to the very essence of what is requred</p></li> <li><p>high fidelity wire Mock Up</p></li> <li><p>uncover the metrics that customers use to measure success</p></li></ul> <p>people were trying to execute when they were using a product or service, rather than studying the product itself.
