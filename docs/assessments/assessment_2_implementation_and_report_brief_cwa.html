To this end, over the course of two assessments you will use a data driven approach to identify a specific area in which students are being underserved and implement a prototype SPA to better serve students in your identified problem space.</p> <p><img src="/web-dev-2020-notes/assets/img/design_thinking_process_assessment_2.bc03e10c.png" alt=""></p> <p><strong>Figure 1</strong>, The design thinking methodology, adapted from Interaction Design Foundation (n.d.).</p> <p>Once again, In using the design thinking (DT) methodology as a lens (see Figure 1), this assessment represents the prototype and test phases of the overarching DT methodology.

If students are not 'fit to study’, they can either request an extension to the submission deadline of 5 working days or they can request to submit the assessment at the next opportunity (Defer). In both instances students must submit an EC application with relevant evidence. If accepted by the EC Panel there will be no academic penalty for late submission or non-submission dependent on what is requested. Students are reminded that EC covers only short term issues (20 working days) and that if they experience longer term matters that impact on learning then they must contact the Student Hub for advice.</p> <p>Please find a link to the EC policy below:</p> <p>https://students.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/quality-management/academic-handbook/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf</p> <h3 id="academic-misconduct"><a href="#academic-misconduct" class="header-anchor">#</a> Academic Misconduct</h3> <p>Any submission must be students’ own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced.
