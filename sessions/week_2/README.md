# Introduction to React

By the end of this week you should be able to address the following questions:

- What is React?- What are React components?

- What are props?

- What is JSX?

- How can we iterate over a list to output components?

- How do you create a compositional component and what is the point?

- How can I apply conditional styling to components?

- In what direction does data flow through a React Application?

In order to do this we are going to start working on our class project - [a goal tracking application](https://www.figma.com/file/rTbqRpRWOw7UYg28SBcxQv/web-dev-pratical-task-made-using-toxin-ui?node-id=31262%3A3)

## Why React

I am very excited to be introducing React to you this week.

According to the [React](https://reactjs.org/) documentation, "it makes it painless to create interactive UIs." Having used React in a production business environment I certainly agree with this sentiment.

Speaking broadly, React offers the following benefits:

- A light layer of functionality on top of JavaScript
- An experienced React developer is also an experienced JavaScript developer
- We can program in React-Native to make native mobile application
- However, at the time of writing React-Native is somewhat falling out of fashion
- The React job market is buoyant and developers are demanding high salaries

## Video Walk Through

For the more visually inclined I have created a tutorial walking you through this weeks notes:

## Creating your first React app

`npx`, just like `npm`, is a tool that is installed with node. `npx` allows us to run executables that are stored in the `npm` repository. We can use `npx` to quickly scaffold a React application:

## Task 1 Create your first react application :rocket:

<iframe src="https://solent.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=052d879f-385a-4c8e-a0f4-ac5201289fe6&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&start=182&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

1.1 From within command line run:

```js
npx create-react-app web-dev-for-industry-practical
cd my-app
npm start

```

1.2 Version control your work and upload it to a GitHub Repo

1.3 See if you can change the home-page your App to "Hello World" and import a different picture.

## React Components

React apps are created through composing a series of reusable components - everything in your app is a component. They allow you to split your UI into a series of reusable pieces.

Conceptually a component in react is a JavaScript function.

```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

You can also use a ES6 class to define a component:

```js
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

Both of the techniques above create equivalent components. Historically, class components differentiated themselves from their functional equivalent in that only a class component could access state and lifecycle methods. However, React 16.8. introduced [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that democratised functions giving the capabilities of components. As such, there is no need in 2019 to continue using classes - functions are easier to use and more concise.

## JSX

Some of you may have already noticed that something odd is going on with regards to our JavaScript. For instance, `return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;` is not valid JavaScript, it is known as JSX.

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript and allows you to combine the full power of JavaScript to construct views. Let's consider a more complete example in updating our `src/App` function:

```js
function App() {
  const name = "Joe Appleton";
  const heading = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

  const sum = (x,y) =>  x + y;

  return (
  <div>
    {heading}
    <h2> Yo {name} </h2>
    <h2>  What is the answer to 1 +1. Is it {sum(1,1)} ? </h2>
  </div>
  );
 }
}
```

There are a few points of note to understand in the above example

- `return(...)` the parentheses `()` is ES6 and allows us to return on multiple lines
- To nest variables and expressions within our JSX we must use curly brackets (e.g. `{name}`)
- There must be a single parent set of tags within the return statement. In this instance - `<div> ... </div>`
- Every react component **must** return something

:::tip

## Task 2 Use JSX :rocket:

As I did above, create a new React application and add some JSX to your `App.js` file.

## Components and Props

Throughout the course of this unit we are going to be making a goal tracking application. You can see a mock-up of the application [here](https://www.figma.com/file/rTbqRpRWOw7UYg28SBcxQv/web-dev-pratical-task-made-using-toxin-ui?node-id=31277%3A210). The premise is we track our goals and are held accountable to our friends for a fix period of time. For a set period of time (e.g 30 days), we log our habits and receive a score out of 20.

Today, we are going to work on a very small pice of this application - the part that will track the number of days completed (see below).

![](./assets/completed_view.png)

Let's start thinking about how we would represent the above section of interface as a component.

## Days Completed Component

Typically a single folder or file represents a component, all of these components will live in a `src/Components`

:::tip

## Task 3 Set Up a Component :rocket:

<iframe src="https://solent.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=052d879f-385a-4c8e-a0f4-ac5201289fe6&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&start=1143&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

- Crate a folder `Components` in the src folder - 'src/Components'
- Create the file `src/Components/DaysCompleted.js`
- Add the following code to `DaysCompleted.js`

```js
// src/Components/DaysCompleted.js

import React from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

function DaysCompleted(props) {
  const { days } = props;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1> {days} Days Completed</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

DaysCompleted.propTypes = {
  days: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
};

export default DaysCompleted;
```

In `App.js`, let's use our component. Within `src/App.js`:

- Import our new component `import DaysCompleted from './Components/DaysCompleted'`
- We can now use it in our `App` function like this:

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <DaysCompleted days={15} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

:::

## Props

Components can accept inputs know as `props`. Props are one of the main mechanisms to facilitate data flow around our application.

::: warning
Prop data in a React application can only flow from a parent component to a child.
:::

We pass a prop value to a component through the use of the given components attribute. In this case, we are passing 15 to the component DaysCompleted.

`<DaysCompleted days={15}/>`

React will then construct a Prop object and pass it in as the first argument in our functional component. Notice how, within `DaysCompleted.js` we use a technique know as destructuring to extract the value `days` out of our props object:

```js
const { days } = props;
```

The above is the equivalent of:

```js
const days = props.days;
```

### Prop Types

Since each component could in theory have any number of props, we can use `PropTypes` to describe props that our component intends to receive:

```js
DaysCompleted.propTypes = {
  days: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
};
```

Using the `PropType` above, if days is not passed in as a prop you will see a warning in the console. You can, of course, validate different [types](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) (e.g. `PropTypes.array`, `PropTypes.bool`, `PropTypes.number`)

If a `Prop` is not required, you should ensure that you set a default PropType. We can do this as follows:

```js
DaysCompleted.propTypes = {
  days: PropTypes.number,
};

DaysCompleted.defaultProps = {
  days: 0,
};
```

## Wrapping one component into another

Hmmm, why would you ever want to do such a thing? Let's take another look at the component that we are creating:

![](./assets/completed_view.png)

Can you see the border is slightly raised, creating a tile effect? This effect will need to be re-created throughout our application. As such, we should abstract this tile into a component. We can do this by creating a compositional component.

:::tip

## Task 4 Compositional components :rocket:

<iframe src="https://solent.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=052d879f-385a-4c8e-a0f4-ac5201289fe6&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&start=1946&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Let's create a wrap-around component - also known as a compositional component. Create a new file `Components/Tile.js`. Add the following code:

```js
import React from "react";

function Tile(props) {
  const { children } = props;
  const divStyle = {
    boxShadow: "0px 10px 20px rgba(31, 32, 65, 0.05)",
  };

  return <div style={divStyle}>{children}</div>;
}

export default Tile;
```

The goal of tile is to wrap it around another element or component, it would work like this: `<Tile> <SomeElement/> </Tile>`. This can be achieved by taking advantage of the fact that React injects `<SomeElement/>` into the child property of our `props` object.

See if you can work out how to update `<DaysCompleted>` so `<Tile>` is wrapped around it.

## Task 6 Optional - Have a go at finishing of the component :rocket:

**Tip:** You should look to compose your component using multiple sub components
