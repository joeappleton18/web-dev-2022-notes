## Assessment Task

The practical outcomes for this unit are to create a responsive single page web-application (SPA) that supports Solent University students in some aspect of their day-to-day lives. To this end, over the course of two assessments you will use a data driven approach to identify a specific area in which students are being underserved and implement a prototype SPA to better serve students in your identified problem space.

**Figure 1**, The design thinking methodology, adapted from Interaction Design Foundation (n.d.).

Once again, In using the design thinking (DT) methodology as a lens (see Figure 1), this assessment represents the prototype and test phases of the overarching DT methodology. You will implement the prototype solution that you designed for the first assessment. Your implementation will be in the form of a single page web application (SPA).

## Deliverables

The source code of your solution should include a `documentation.md` file, produced using valid markdown. This file should be 1,500 Words (+/- 10%) in length. While it is not a formal academic styled report, it should not be chatty. Furthermore, it should be produced using valid markdown. You are not required to use a reference list; however, you should try and justify your choices by linking to external papers and articles. You may link to the blogs of expert practitioners; however, do not use product or promotional blogs, these are very biased.

**Your `documentation.md` file should, as a minimum, include the following sections**

### Cover Page

- Project Title
- Name (student number)
- Link to your hosted website
- Link to your Git Repository, which should include a:
  - Professional README.md file
  - Your project's version controlled source files

### Introduction

This should pull together, and summarise, the entire project. You may, at this point, want to re-iterate the problem statement you derived in the first assessment.

### Methodology

You have already defined your overarching methodology, in assessment 1. For this assessment, you need to decide on a development methodology. It is important, what ever methodology you use, you adapt it to meet the needs of a small scale individual project (e.g. see, [Dzhurov, Yani & Krasteva, Iva & Ilieva, Sylvia. (2009).](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229046039_Personal_Extreme_Programming-An_Agile_Process_for_Autonomous_Developers/link/00b7d523ff57b9a937000000/download) Whatever methodology you choose, it must be clear that you have used it. For instance, if you choose agile there should be clearly defined user stories and iterations. You can use the appendix to include items, such as, user stories.

##### Methods

You will need to evaluate your solution with a representative user base. In this section, you will justify the data collection methods you used to conduct an insightful evaluation.

### Conclusion/Results

Given the limited word count, I recommend you combine these sections. You should, based off your results and reflective accounts, evaluate your solution.

### Appendix

Additional supporting information

## Assessment Criteria

You will be assessed, mostly, on the quality of your solution. However, the documentation is important, as it allows me to understand to what extent your solution solves the problem that you defined.

### Learning Outcomes

This assessment will enable students to demonstrate in full or in part the learning
outcomes identified in the Module descriptors.

### Late Submissions

Students are reminded that:

i. If this assessment is submitted late i.e. within 5 working days of the submission deadline, the mark will be capped at 40% if a pass mark is achieved;

ii. If this assessment is submitted <u>later</u> than 5 working days after the submission deadline, the work will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero;

iii. If this assessment is being submitted as a referred piece of work then it must be submitted by the deadline date; <u>any</u> Refer assessment submitted late will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero.

Extenuating Circumstances

The University’s Extenuating Circumstances procedure is in place if there are genuine circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If students are not 'fit to study’, they can either request an extension to the submission deadline of 5 working days or they can request to submit the assessment at the next opportunity (Defer). In both instances students must submit an EC application with relevant evidence. If accepted by the EC Panel there will be no academic penalty for late submission or non-submission dependent on what is requested. Students are reminded that EC covers only short term issues (20 working days) and that if they experience longer term matters that impact on learning then they must contact the Student Hub for advice.

Please find a link to the EC policy below:

### Academic Misconduct

Any submission must be students’ own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced. The University’s Academic Handbook includes the definitions of all practices that will be deemed to constitute academic misconduct. Students should check this link before submitting their work.

Procedures relating to student academic misconduct are given below:

### Ethics Policy

The work being carried out by students must be in compliance with the Ethics Policy. Where there is an ethical issue, as specified within the Ethics Policy, then students will need an ethics release or an ethical approval prior to the start of the project.

The Ethics Policy is contained within Section 2S of the Academic Handbook:

**Grade marking**

The University uses a letter grade scale for the marking of assessments. Unless students have been specifically informed otherwise their marked assignment will be awarded a letter grade. More detailed information on grade marking and the grade scale can be found on the portal and in the Student Handbook
